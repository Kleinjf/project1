1. What did you like about this website?
    - I think you did a really good job at displaying the images, the gallary page looked really nice and
        diplayed the drawings well and also the collage was really cool. The nav bar was also really clean, I
        like how the whole block lights up and you can click anywhere not just on the word itself. The login was cool
        with the campfire behind it and the randomize page was also a cool adition.
2. Describe one significant difference between your own P1 site and this person's. E.g.
    2a. Which has a better user experience (and why)?
        - I think the your user experience was definetely more fun, displaying the drawings in various ways and including
            the interactive randomize section.
    2b. Which codebase do you think would be more maintainable (and why)?
        - I think both are easily maintainable, you did have all your css in one file which I don't think matters since
            the website is only 5 pages, but I think if you expanded the website more then you would need to start breaking out css files for each page when they start having different styling attributes.
3. Is the code well-structured within files, and well-organized between files and directories?
    if not, suggest some specific improvements
        - Yes the code is well structured, you set up the CSS in way that you reused a lot and didn't duplicate which was good. 
4. Did you find any other issues? If so, briefly enumerate them.
    4a. were semantically appropriate elements selected
        - Yes everything was good semantically.
    4b. is the CSS refactored to limit duplication?
        - Yes CSS was done well and limited duplication.
5. Do you have any other constructive comments for the author?
    - You're website resized really well.
    - To be picky, I think you could have made the text boxes a bit more attractive, the white background with the drawings looked good but I don't think the white background with only text fits the best, but I am not the most artictic person and don't have a good sense of what colors match well so I don't know what color you could replace it with. Or you could just do something to make them pop a little more to make them more attractive.
    - Overall really cool way to display all the drawings, clean navigation and website in general, great test page, code was easy to read as well as formated well.
