1. What did you like about this website?
The animation on the home page and the art is interesting. I also liked the Random page.

2. Describe one significant difference between your own P1 site and this person's. E.g.
One difference is my website is a lot more focused on text while theirs is focused on images.
   
   1. Which has a better user experience (and why)?
   Both sites are easy to use and understand, but I'll go with mine since I'm biased. 
   
   2. Which codebase do you think would be more maintainable (and why)?
   I'd say about equal. Both sites have only one CSS file and it's fairly easy to keep track of everything. There's also not a lot of code in general in either site 
   since they're basic. 

3. Is the code well-structured within files, and well-organized between files and directories?
Maybe there was a better way to structure the Gallery code. Besides that, I think the organization and structure is good. 
   1. if not, suggest some specific improvements
   Try for less nested code. 

4. Did you find any other issues? If so, briefly enumerate them.
I think the content is sized poorly on smaller resolutions. I think the navbar could also be improved for smaller resolutions. I also think the Contact and similar pages 
should be on the end of the navbar while the main content is closer to the left/middle.

   1. were semantically appropriate elements selected
   Yes.
   2. is the CSS refactored to limit duplication?
   Yes.

5. Do you have any other constructive comments for the author?
No, but I enjoyed looking at and reviewing your website. Keep up the good work!
